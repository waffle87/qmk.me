* microcontrollers: [sparkfun rp2040 pro micro](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18288)

only complaint is the added height from the buttons, qwiic connector, & usb-c port, but still seems to work with [low profile sockets](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/mill-max-manufacturing-corp/315-43-164-41-003000/ED4764-64-ND/1212143).
`CONVERT_TO = promicro_rp2040` is all the configuration this keyboard needs thanks to the recent converter work :^)
